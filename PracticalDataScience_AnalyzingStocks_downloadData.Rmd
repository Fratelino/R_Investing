title: "Practical Data Science: Analyzing Stock Market Data with R"

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. 

Based on a Udemy Class
(https://www.udemy.com/practical-data-science-analyzing-stock-market-data-with-r/learn/lecture/3374968#overview)

using quantmod from Cran
(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/quantmod/)


Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# install.packages('quantmod')
library(quantmod)
```
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
?quantmod
```

We'll use Yahoo here but Google Finance is also supported. 
(https://finance.yahoo.com/lookup/)
In this case we'll use the S&P 500 as an example; code GSPC on Yahoo

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
getSymbols('^GSPC', src='yahoo')
```
``` {r}
head(GSPC)
```
``` {r}
tail(GSPC)
```
``` {r}
class(GSPC)
```
XTS is time series data and zoo is also time series data. 

``` {r}
summary(GSPC)
```

Also how to call multiple symbols at once by creating a vector of symbols
and then pass the basket to the getSymbols function.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
symbolBasket <- c('AAPL', 'AMZN', 'BRK-B')
getSymbols(symbolBasket , src='yahoo')
```

Summary will show us basics
```{r setup, include=TRUE}
summary(`BRK-B`)
```

Now lets group them all together for a future comparison. 
Trick here is we might not have the same amount of data due to age of stocks
we'll use the XTS nature of the data to hook them together. 

NOTE: BRK-B IS ODD SO IT NEEDS THE `` AROUND IT

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
symbolBasketGrp <- data.frame(as.xts(merge(AAPL, AMZN, `BRK-B`)))
```

Let's have a look

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
head(symbolBasketGrp)
```

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
tail(symbolBasketGrp)
```

================== NOTES on Syntax below here
two options for code in MarkDown
```{r setup, include=TRUE}
getSymbols('^GSPC', src='yahoo')
```


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
getSymbols('^GSPC', src='yahoo')
```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
